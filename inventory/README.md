Monitoring Studio X REST API through TSPS: Global Monitoring Inventory

Assessing the monitoring coverage of a large environment can be challenging. Luckily, [Monitoring Studio X](https://www.sentrysoftware.com/products/km-monitoring-studio-x.html) and [Hardware Sentry KM](https://www.sentrysoftware.com/products/km-hardware-sentry.html) offer a REST API that can be leveraged to build a monitoring inventory.

The **inventoryFunctions.ps1** PowerShell script and **inventoryFunctions.sh** bash script report the number of monitored systems (which can be useful to count the number of required licenses too).

The **inventoryFunctions.ps1** PowerShell script has been designed for and tested on a Windows 10 Professional Edition (PowerShell version 5.1)
